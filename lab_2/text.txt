Control myself among the crowd of distraught,
You who swear by all of the confusion,
Believe in myself, in spite of the universe,
And little faith let their sin;
Let H to not come, wait, not tired,
Let the lying liars, not condescend to them;
Know how to forgive and not seem forgiving,
Generous and wise friend.

Know how to dream, without becoming a slave of dream,
And to think, thought not deify;
Meet equal success, and a reproach,
Not forgetting that their voice is a liar;
Stay quiet when your same word
Cripples rogue, that taketh the fools,
When the whole life is ruined, and again
You have to recreate everything from the basics.

Know how to put in joyful hope,
At stake is everything that has accumulated with difficulty,
All lose, and the poor become as before,
And never regret,
Be able to force the heart, nerves, body
Serve you when your chest
It has long been all empty, all burned,
Only Will says, Go!

Stay simple, conversing with kings,
Stay honest, spoke to the crowd;
Be direct and firm with enemies and friends,
Let everything in its hour, considered with you;
Give meaning to every moment,
Hours and days of relentless running,
Then the whole world you take into possession,
Then, my son, thou shalt be a man!
